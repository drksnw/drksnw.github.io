But I also like programming a lot. (That's why I have a GitHub page, duh.)\r\nMy favorites languages are Java and Python, but I also know others languages like C, C++/Qt, and a very little bit of Ruby.\r\nI also use Linux as my main operating system, because yeah, how can you code on an OS like Wandows ? xD\r\n\r\n### Social\r\nYou can follow me on Twitter (@epicdarksnow) but I don't tweet often, because I have better things to do...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
